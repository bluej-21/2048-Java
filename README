Short Responses:

1) The command would be :%s/fun/amazing/g. This command will 
   replace all the instances of fun with amazing. To only replace
   the first instance of fun with amazing in each line, you 
   would use the command, :%s/fun/amazing. This command will only
   change the first instance of the word fun to amazing.

2) The command you would do would be mkdir -p fooDir/barDir This 
   command will make barDir inside of fooDir.

3) One command involving the wildcard character I use the most is
   javac *.java. This command will compile all the files with
   the .java at the end of it. So it will compile all the
   java files.

4) The command you would use is gvim -p *.java. This command will
   open all the java source code files, each on a different
   tab.

5) The keyword static, when placed in the method header, makes the
   method a static method which means that the method is shared
   in the class instead of being object-focused. An example would
   be if I had a static method in the Gui2048.java file. I could
   call that method by writing Gui2048.staticMethod(). The
   method will not need an object to be called on.

6) I would recommend the student to use inheritance. She could
   have a abstract base class named Shape, and in that class, she
   will have the method draw. And she will make the different
   shape class like circle class, square class and so on. And
   in those individual classes she should make the color
   a instance variable and override the draw method. Using this
   she will be able to draw each shape with more ease and could
   even use an array of Shape to draw all the shapes.
